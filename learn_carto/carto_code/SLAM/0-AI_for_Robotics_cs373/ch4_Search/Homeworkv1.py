# USER INSTRUCTIONS
#
# Write a function called stochastic_value that 
# returns two grids. The first grid, value, should 
# contain the computed value of each cell as shown 
# in the video. The second grid, policy, should 
# contain the optimum policy for each cell.
#
# --------------
# GRADING NOTES
#
# We will be calling your stochastic_value function
# with several different grids and different values
# of success_prob, collision_cost, and cost_step.
# In order to be marked correct, your function must
# RETURN (it does not have to print) two grids,
# value and policy.
#
# When grading your value grid, we will compare the
# value of each cell with the true value according
# to this model. If your answer for each cell
# is sufficiently close to the correct answer
# (within 0.001), you will be marked as correct.

delta = [[-1, 0 ], # go up
         [ 0, -1], # go left
         [ 1, 0 ], # go down
         [ 0, 1 ]] # go right

delta_name = ['^', '<', 'v', '>'] # Use these when creating your policy grid.

    policy = [[' ' for col in range(len(grid[0]))] for row in range(len(grid))]
